FBLA Project for Mobile App Development

Schools United is a mobile application built for Android operating systems. To use the app, users can either fill out their login info or sign up as a new user. Our app will save the user info or check the user info to login. Once the user passes through our login, they will be sent to the home screen. From the home screen, they will be able to access all main parts of the app through the navigation sidebar as well as view their students/kids upcoming assignments. When the sidebar is clicked, Users will be presented a variety of option pages to travel to, each serving its own functionality. On the “Home” page, users will be able to navigate back into the original page from any of the other pages and serve as a connection from each page to the home screen. The next option is the “Calendar” option. From here, users can look at a calendar already synced to the current date and view their events as well as their dates. The next option is the messages option, which is a quick and easy way for users to message teachers, with the option to directly message teachers or any students inside the application. Next is the “Settings” page. The Settings page currently has just a bug report system that also has the ability to send emails directly to our email. The final option is the add event feature which is used to directly add events to the database and to the calendar, and is the main feature of our app. Events can be used for all sorts of things such as tests/quizzes or assignments, and are reminders for parents for their kids' assignments. If the teacher doesn’t mark an item completed for the student, the reminder will stay on the home screen and calendar and will become overdue on the home screen. 

*Our app connects parents to teachers by having them be part of the process of their kids' assignments as well as being able to message them through the app, without much effort
